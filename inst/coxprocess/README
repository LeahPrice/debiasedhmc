This folder has scripts that implements a log-Gaussian Cox point process model
on the finpine dataset, as considered in MÃ¸ller et al. (1998)

We consider the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Riemann manifold Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (RHMC) with the metric tensor advocated in Girolami & Calderhead (2011)

First run model.R to load the dataset and relevant functions, which will be saved
in this folder as coxprocess.RData and coxprocess_with_metric.RData

Next use the script hmc.repeats.R and rm.hmc.repeats.R to compute as many replicates
of the proposed unbiased estimator as desired, for example by running many instances
of this script on a compute cluster, and saves the results in the output/ folder as
RData files

See Heng and Jacob (2017) for details on the selection of algorithmic parameters
employed in hmc.repeats.R and rhmc.repeats.R

Run optimal.hmc.R and optimal.rm.hmc.R to compute the asymptotic variance of these
optimally tuned algorithms

Lastly, run plot.hmc.repeats.R and plot.rm.hmc.repeats.R to summarize the results
