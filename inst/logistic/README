This folder has scripts that implements logistic regression on the German credit
dataset, as considered in Hoffman & Gelman (2014)

First run model.R to load the dataset and relevant functions, which will be saved
in this folder as germancredit.RData

Next use the script hmc.repeats.R to compute as many replicates of the proposed
unbiased estimator as desired, for example by running many instances of this
script on a compute cluster, and saves the results in the output/ folder as
RData files

See Heng and Jacob (2017) for details on the selection of algorithmic parameters
employed in hmc.repeats.R

Run optimal.hmc.R to compute the asymptotic variance of optimally tuned HMC

Lastly, run plot.hmc.repeats.R to summarize the results
