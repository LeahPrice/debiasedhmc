This folder has scripts that implements two examples from Pakman & Paninski (2014):
a truncated Gaussian constrained by linear constraints (linear.R, plot.linear.R),
and quadratic constraints (quadratic.R, plot.quadratic.R)

Running either linear.R or quadratic.R performs the computations described in
Heng and Jacob (2017) and saves the results in the output/ folder as RData files

Running the corresponding plot.linear.R or plot.quadratic.R script then summarizes
the results
